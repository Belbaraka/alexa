# Benchmark SSL 

We design in what follows a benchmark to characterize and compare sound source localization algorithms. We use different setups to assess the performances of the algorithms in different situations.



## I - Shoe Box Room

Shoe box room are rectangular parallelepiped. In this situation, source oclusion can't happen. 
Microphones are placed around a sphere of radius $10 cm$ at the center of the room and the source is placed at the position $(1,1,1)$

**Constants**

* Room Dimensions : $3m * 5m * 2.5m$
* Max Order : $4$

- Absorbtion factor : $0.2$ (for all walls)
- Number of sources : $1$

### 1. Setup n째1 : 5 microphones

**Results**

- *ML-TDOA* : on average the $L2$ Distance between ground truth position and recovered postion is : $60 cm$
- *SRP-PHAT* : on average the $L2$ Distance between ground truth position and recovered postion is: $2 cm$

### 2. Setup n째2 : 50 microphones

**Results**

- *ML-TDOA* : on average the $L2$ Distance between ground truth position and recovered postion is: 40 cm
- *SRP-PHAT* : on average the $L2$ Distance between ground truth position and recovered postion is: 2 cm

### 3. Conlusion

From these 2 setups we can observe that by increasing the number of microphones the accuracy of the *ML-TDOA* algorithm has increased. However, *SRP-PHAT* always performs better than *ML-TDOA*, this difference of performance can be explained by the fact that the beamforming-based approach (*SRP-PHAT*) is robust in adverse acoustic environments.



## II - L-Shaped Room

In this context source oclusion could happen, and we will model it to see how both algorithm perform.
Again, microphones are placed around a sphere of radius $10 cm$ but this time at position $(4, 2, 1)$

**Constants**

- Surface dimensions : $ (3m, 3m, 5m, 2m, 2m, 1m)$
- Elevation : $2m$
- Max Order = $4$
- Absorbtion factor = $0.2 $  (for all walls)
- Number of Sources: 1 
- Number of Microphones: 5

### 1. Setup n째1 : no occlusion

The source is placed at :  $(1, 2, 1)$

**Results**

- *ML-TDOA* : on average the $L2$ Distance between ground truth position and recovered postion is : $121 cm$
- *SRP-PHAT* : on average the $L2$ Distance between ground truth position and recovered postion is : $45 cm$

### 2. Setup n째2 : occlusion

The source is placed at :  $(2.5, 0.5, 1)$

**Results**

- *ML-TDOA* : on average the $L2$ Distance between ground truth position and recovered postion is : $260 cm$
- *SRP-PHAT* : on average the $L2$ Distance between ground truth position and recovered postion is :  $57 cm$

### 3. Conlusion

Occlusion decreases the performance of both algorithms. SRP-PHAT's performance has decreased the most but it is still more robust than ML-TDOA.
