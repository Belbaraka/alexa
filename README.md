## Abstract
Sound source localization has been a field of interest for scientists since the time of  ancient  Greeks.   However, the  investigations  of  the  acoustic  cues  used  for  sound source  localization  only  began  in  the  19th  century .   It  started  with  British  scientistJohn William Strutt conducting the garden experiment.  He discovered that time and intensity differences between both ears could account for his ability to identify the location of people who spoke in his garden.  The environment in which we are studying our sound source plays a crucial role because it determines the underlying properties of the sound waves propagation.  While the above experiment was conducted in a open field, we will focus in this report on sound source localization in enclosures, as this is a more challenging and difficult task to model than the free-field case.  The problem we are trying to solve can be formulated as follows; suppose a sound source inside a room, given the microphoneâ€™s recording(s) and *eventually* additional information, the goal is to localize the source.
